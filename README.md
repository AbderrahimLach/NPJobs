# NPJobs
NPJobs is a fun Bukkit/Spigot plugin designed to allow operators to hire NPC workers to do various supported jobs such as construction, farming, and guarding.
Hence, the project name is a combination of both NPC and Jobs. 
At the moment the plugin only supports construction. Farming and guarding are still work in progress.
